# hello-world
Testing: 
I started off trying to follow the tutorial.
I had some difficulty finding the xamples comparison box but got it now.
I  need to find out what is happening with my keyboard as I need to type twice to get an  inverted comma \I managed to create a conflict in a branch called  ..-patch1 and still have not been able to resolve them so it is just a dead end branch. Is that OK?
I had Another go at editing the master file
This time I will make a pull request and then commit another change.
And then make another change directly to master, this all looks clean.
